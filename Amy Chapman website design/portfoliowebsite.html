  <h2><b> ABOUT ME</b> </h2>
  <p> &#10077; My name is Amy Chapman and I am from a place called Whanganui which is located on the lower half of the North Island.  I am currently a first year student studying design at Wellington Massey University and have produced many pieces of work.  Being creative and exploring different design ideas is something that I love to do.  Since a very young age, I have enjoyed playing around with paint, drawing techniques and making collages, leaving my bedroom floor in a big mess. Only to repeat it the next day. During my second year of high school, I was introduced to the concept of expressing my creativity through Graphic Design and photography. Ever since then my passion for design keeps on increasing and has became a part of who I am.</p>

<p>My inspiration comes from a number of different places, but one of the major areas that I draw inspiration from at the moment is through different emotions and my past experiences through traveling to different places across the globe. I love to produce works that are different and unique, and also pieces in which are symbolic towards myself and the world around us in which we live in. &#10078;
